# R7L Labs

*Developing for WARJORN / INTERIM*

## 🚀 Mission

R7L Labs is dedicated to building high-quality, open-source tooling and plugins (primarily in Python) for the gaming and server-management ecosystem. Our focus is on reliability, extensibility, and community-driven development.

## 🧩 What we do

* Maintain core plugins, frameworks, and utilities (for example, **Need X** – our core plugin for the R7L suite).
* Develop add-on modules like the **Lag Manager**, designed to improve performance and stability in game-server environments.
* Foster a community of contributors, encourage pull requests and issues, and maintain transparent development practices.
* Document best practices and workflows so users of our plugins can adopt them easily.

## 📂 Projects

Here are some of our highlighted repositories:

* **Need X**: Core plugin in the R7L suite (Python, PySpigot)
* **Lag Manager**: A performance-monitoring plugin for the R7L suite (Python, PySpigot)

*(For full list of repos, see the “Repositories” tab on our GitHub org page.)*

## 💡 Why work with us?

* We’re building from the ground up, so there’s ample opportunity to define architecture, patterns, and standards.
* Open to contributions: Whether you’re an experienced plugin developer or just getting started, we welcome collaboration.
* We believe in **clean**, **well-documented**, **maintainable** code.
* Our tooling is aimed at real-world server environments — performance, reliability and usability matter.

## 📖 How to contribute

1. Fork the relevant repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`feature/<your-feature>` or `bugfix/<issue-number>`).
3. Follow the repository’s coding style and add tests/comments as appropriate.
4. Submit a pull request explaining your changes and linking any related issue.
5. Be open to review — we follow a peer-review workflow to keep things high standard.

## 🛠 Tech stack & tooling

* **Language(s)**: Python (primarily), Java
* **Platform**: PySpigot plugins for Minecraft-style server environments
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated tests, linting, and packaging
* **License**: [MIT](LICENSE) (unless otherwise specified in individual repos)
* **Documentation**: Markdown in each repo, plus central guidelines in `.github`

## 📅 Roadmap (high-level)

* Improve documentation for each plugin: usage examples, configuration, monitoring.
* Introduce metrics & telemetry in “Lag Manager” for proactive server-health insights.
* Expand plugin ecosystem with tools for server-admins beyond performance: e.g., resource-management, moderation aids, analytics.
* Establish a contribution program: onboarding guides, “good first issue” labels, contributor recognition.

## 📬 Stay in touch

* Use GitHub Issues and Discussions in each repository for feedback, feature requests, and bug reports.
* Want to reach out directly? Feel free to email `contact@r7l.org` (or update with your preferred contact info)
* Follow updates by watching our organization or subscribing to repo notifications.

If you like, I can format this for you with badges (license, build status, Python versions), include a logo image, or split it into sections per repository. Would you like me to generate that?
